# estoiles-public
This repository contains all the code for the figures and analysis in [Wang et al. (2021)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PhRvD.103h4007W/abstract).

The [`estoiles/`](estoiles/) directory contains the actual calculation code. 

The [`drivers/`](drivers/) directory contains the scripts for making the figures, generating the necessary data and running example analysis. 

To create the figures and run example analysis, first run `python setup.py install`. Then run the scripts in the [`drivers/`](drivers/) directory.
